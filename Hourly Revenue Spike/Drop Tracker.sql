/*
Hourly Revenue Spike/Drop Tracker

Objective:
Develop a tool to detect abnormal hourly revenue spikes or drops by comparing current hour performance to the same hour on the previous day.

Requirements:
Compare each hour (e.g., 12 PM on 6/8/25 vs. 12 PM on 6/7/25).
Allow dynamic baseline resets (e.g., to account for advertiser changes).
Highlight significant deviations (e.g., Â±X% threshold).
